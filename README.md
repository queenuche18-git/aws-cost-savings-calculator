# AWS Cost Savings Calculator ☁️💰
This repository documents a technical case study on optimizing AWS foundational costs for single-server applications.
## 📊 Optimization Results
By analyzing the AWS Pricing Calculator, I identified a path to reduce recurring monthly costs by **60%**.
* **Initial Estimate:** $19.05 USD/month
* **Optimized Estimate:** $7.73 USD/month
### 🛠️ Strategic Changes Made:
* **Compute:** Switched to the ARM-based **t4g.nano** instance (more cost-efficient than standard x86).
* **Storage:** Upgraded from **gp2** to **gp3** volumes, which offers a lower price point and better performance.
## 🔗 Community Context
I shared these findings on LinkedIn to help other students realize that cloud learning doesn't have to be expensive. I also feel encouraged to document this properly here on GitHub
